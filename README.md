# OldSchool Runescape Ping 

A Python script used to ping OldSchool RuneScape worlds. Should work on MacOS, Linux and Windows (10)!

## Usage

python osrs-ping.py [-h] world_list [n_tests]

Currently, the allowed choice for world_list is:

* uk
* allworlds
* custom_list
* an integer for a single world

If the n_tests is not provided, it will default to n_tests = 5.
